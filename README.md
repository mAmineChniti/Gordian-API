Welcome to the documentation for Gordian â€“ a basic API designed to handle user registration and login seamlessly.

## Getting Started

To start using Gordian and access its documentation, please visit the [Gordian website](https://gordian.onrender.com).

## Technologies Used

Gordian API is built using the following technologies:

- Python
- FastAPI
- MongoDB
- [Render](https://render.com/)

## Running Gordian API Locally for Development

Follow these steps to run Gordian API on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Project

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mAmineChniti/Gordian-API.git
cd Gordian-API
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

#### MongoDB

Set up these environment variables in your local environment:

| Variable   | Description             |
|------------|-------------------------|
| USER       | MongoDB Username        |
| PASS       | MongoDB Password        |
| BASE       | MongoDB Database Name   |
| COLLECTION | MongoDB Collection Name |
| HOST       | MongoDB Host            |

You can adjust the configuration by modifying the code in `config/database.py` to match your environment.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command in your terminal to set up the project environment and install necessary dependencies:

```shell
make
```

The provided `Makefile` automates the setup process, creating a virtual environment, activating it, upgrading `pip`, and installing project dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

### 4. Deploy the API

To deploy the API locally, use the following command:

```shell
uvicorn Gordian:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --reload
```

### 5. Access the API

Once the API is running locally, you can access it through your web browser at:

- <http://localhost:PORT>

Make sure to replace `PORT` with the actual port number you've specified.
